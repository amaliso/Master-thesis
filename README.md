The file "PA6_08mm_nozzle_longitudinal" includes calculations of mechanical properties, stiffness, strength and toughness for the PA6-CF 0.8 mm nozzle specimens under longitudinal loading, and curve-fitting data to exponential function $y=ax^b$.
It also shows all plots for density (D) and geometry (G) scaling with curve-fits for the specimens in the PA6-CF 0.8 mm nozzle longitudinal test. 

The same methods were used for the other tests; PA6-CF 0.4 mm longitudinal, PA6-CF 0.4 mm and 0.8 mm lateral, and PLA 0.4 mm and 0.8 mm lateral and longitudinal. 

In the file "Predictions_PLA_08mm_nozzle" the code for calculating and plotting predictive capabilities of the PLA 0.8 mm nozzle under lateral loading are found. 
It includes predicting for both density (D) and geometry (G) scales, for specimens with characteristics G95=const. in density scale, and D.038=const. in geometry scale.
